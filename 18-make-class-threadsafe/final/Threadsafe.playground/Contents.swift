//: # Make a Class Threadsafe
//: ## The Problem: Race Condition
//: When you're using asynchronous calls then you need to consider thread safety.
//: Consider the following object:
let nameChangingPerson = Person(firstName: "Alison", lastName: "Anderson")
//: The `Person` class includes a method to change names:
nameChangingPerson.changeName(firstName: "Brian", lastName: "Biggles")
nameChangingPerson.name
//: What happens if you try and use the `changeName(firstName:lastName:)` simulataneously from a concurrent queue?
let workerQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.raywenderlich.worker", attributes: .concurrent)
let nameChangeGroup = DispatchGroup()

let nameList = [("Charlie", "Cheesecake"), ("Delia", "Dingle"), ("Eva", "Evershed"), ("Freddie", "Frost"), ("Gina", "Gregory")]

// Comment out the code below before you implement ThreadSafePerson
//for (idx, name) in nameList.enumerated() {
//  workerQueue.async(group: nameChangeGroup) {
//    usleep(UInt32(10_000 * idx))
//    nameChangingPerson.changeName(firstName: name.0, lastName: name.1)
//    print("Current Name: \(nameChangingPerson.name)")
//  }
//}
//
//nameChangeGroup.notify(queue: DispatchQueue.global()) {
//  print("Final name: \(nameChangingPerson.name)")
//  PlaygroundPage.current.finishExecution()
//}
//
//nameChangeGroup.wait()
//: ## The Solution: Dispatch Barrier for Thread Safety
//: A barrier allows you add a task to a concurrent queue that will be run in a serial fashion, i.e., it will wait for the currently queued tasks to complete, and prevent any new ones starting.
class ThreadSafePerson: Person {
  // DONE: Write this implementation
  let isolationQueue = DispatchQueue(label: "com.raywenderlich.person.isolation",
    attributes: .concurrent)

  override func changeName(firstName: String, lastName: String) {
    isolationQueue.async(flags: .barrier) {
      // barrier task
      super.changeName(firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName)
    }
  }
  
  // Use .sync to safely access to name
  override var name: String {
    isolationQueue.sync {
      super.name
    }
  }
  
}
